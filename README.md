## Introduction
	
POWER management  is  a very important  issue  in  portable  electronic applications. The  need for  multiple  on-chip  voltage levels makes voltage regulators a critical part of an electronic system design. Portable electronic devices like cell phones require very efficient power management to increase the battery life whereas high-speed microprocessors need stable voltages that can supply fast varying currents on the order of few amperes.

The choice of a voltage regulator for a given  application offers numerous design tradeoff considerations.The emphasis on efficiency has made low dropout (LDO) regulators the most popular class of linear regulators. But this increase in efficiency is achieved at the cost of a compromise in stability of the regulator. LDO regulators have high output impedance; this impedance, along with the load capacitance, creates a low frequency pole and decreases the overall phase margin.

This design gives an overview of stability problems in LDO voltage regulators and presents a modified LDO voltage regulator topology. Although the compensating circuit is very simple, the proposed topology successfully overcomes the problem of stability without significantly increasing the power consumption or die area.
	

## Problem-with-Typical-LDO-voltage-regulator

A closer look of a typical LDO voltage regulator reveals the fact that there are two low-frequency poles that need to be taken into consideration in evaluating the frequency response of the LDO’s closed-loop transfer function. One of the poles lies at the output of the regulator and the other one at the gate of the pass transistor.
There are, at least, two additional parasitic poles present in the LDO regulator. The third pole is lumped to the noninverting terminal of the error amplifier as a result of the input stage parasitic capacitors.
The error amplifier contributes with an internal pole since two-stage or cascode amplifiers are used to increase the amplifier’s dc gain. The system is therefore potentially unstable.

## Capacitive-Feedback-for-Frequency-Compensation

The basic idea behind the capacitive feedback which is responsible for frequency compensation is to introduce a left hand plane zero in the feedback loop that would replace the zero generated by ESR of the output capacitor. The proposed method starts with the addition of a pole–zero pair and proceeds toward eliminating the pole from the pole–zero pair.

The capacitor  is split into two frequency-dependent voltage-controlled current sources (VCCS) and grounded capacitors. The capacitor C1 and  the VCCS connected to vout do not significantly  alter  the voltage at that node since  CL is of severa l microfarads, whereas  C1  is on the order of few picofarads. It should also be noted that the  capacitor connected to vx is responsible for the additional pole Wp3; therefore it is eliminated to arrive to the final configuration of Fig. 1. This configuration generates the required zero; the LDO becomes a  two-loop  system. The VCCS is  a differentiator that increases the loop gain at high frequencies. The loop gain transfer function of the regulator with this configuration has one zero and two poles.

</p>

## Design-Considerations-for-the-VCCS

The transistor-level design challenge lies in realizing the frequency dependent VCCS with minimum die area and minimum power consumption while retaining the VCCS characteristics up to crossover  frequency of the loop  transfer function. The  simplest  realization of  this  circuit  and  transconductance gain enhanced structure is shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) respectively.The bias current can be selected to meet the objective of minimal standby current; the limit is however determined by the frequency of its parasitic pole.

	<h5 align="center">Figure 3: Simplest realization of frequency dependent VCCS. (a) Simplest realization and (b) transconductance gain enhanced structure.</h5>
</p>

We need to improve the effective transconductance by increasing the bias current drastically increases the power consumption ( scales proportional to the square root of bias current). Therefore, alternate Gm enhancement techniques should be explored.
The transistor realization is shown in Fig. 4. The circuit consists of three parts. The first stage acts as a level-shifting buffer needed to down-shift the dc level which can be very close to  the  supply  voltage due to LDO characteristics of the regulator. The next stage is with enhancing OTA in feedback. The third stage consists of a 1:5 current mirror and bias sources that together perform  the  function of pumping the ac current through output. We can take advantage of a multiplication factor in the current mirror to increase the effective capacitance from 5 to 25 pF. Cascode current mirror and cascode bias current sources (bias by proper dc voltages and ) are used such that offset current is not significant enough to upset the dc output voltage of the regulator.

## Error-Amplifier

The error amplifier design demands careful attention to meet the required loop gain, transient response and stability. 
Ideal requirements of the error amplifier are: 1) high dc gain to ensure high loop gain (typically) for all loads; 
					       2) low output impedance to keep the pole at the input of the pass transistor at high frequencies; 
					       3) positive rail output to turn offpass transistor when the load turns off; and 
					       4) internal poles at significantly higher frequencies compared to the cross over loop frequency.
High output impedance of the error amplifier pushes the pole at the input of the pass transistor Wp2 to lower frequencies. Wp2 is pushed to higher frequencies by limiting the output impedance of the error amplifier; hence the use of a two-stage error amplifier is a must.

	<h5 align="center">Figure 5: Transistor level implementation of error amplifier.</h5>
</p>

## Pass-Transistor

The important design consideration for the pass transistor is the dropout voltage. Increasing the size of the pass transistor lowers the dropout voltage for a particular output current, but wider pass transistor introduces higher input capacitance making it difficult to meet stability and slew rate requirements. The design presented uses a pass transistor of W/L ratio of 6000 that gives a maximum output current of 100 mA with a dropout voltage of 0.5 V. Minimum length is not used as it makes the transistor output impedance unacceptably low at high load currents

## Working

Linear regulators are responsible for providing a stable supply voltage to a load circuit, regardless of how much current the load circuitry is consuming. As shown in Figure 2, a regulator is comprised of a power transistor and a control feedback loop. The power transistor is responsible for providing the necessary current to the load. The control circuitry that implements  is placed in a feedback loop to drive the power transistor such that the output of the regulator is regulated to the desired voltage. For integrated circuits, the load is typically a current source in parallel with a load capacitance.

### Feedback Mechanism

(1) When load current is increasing:-

When load current is increased instantaneously, the load capacitor supplies the extra current and the capacitor voltage drops. This drop in output voltage is sensed by the feedback circuit which in turn pulls down the gate of the pMOS pass transistor thus turning it on and supplying the output current needed by the capacitor and load impedance. Since the compensating circuit is a differentiator, it helps increasing the loop feedback for fast output variations. On the other hand, if ESR is used, the instantaneous current flows through the resistor increasing further the overshoots at the LDO output, especially if large ESR is used.

(2) When load current is decreasing:-

When the load current is decreased instantaneously, the extra current from the output of the pass transistor charges the output capacitor to a higher than nominal voltage. The feedback loop reacts by switching the error amplifier to positive saturation limit thereby turning off the pass transistor. The excess charge on the output capacitor is discharged through the feedback resistors; hence the discharge time is large because R1 and R2 are in the range of hundreds of kilo ohms.

## Challenges Faced

-Meeting the error amplifier design demands which is the high dc gain ( > 60 dB) and low output impedance.


## Conclusion

This Design presented a novel  LDO  regulator topology aiming at more robust  frequency compensation by getting rid of the dependence on ESR of the output capacitor. A detailed description of the implementation of the topology in CMOS technology is presented. Although the compensating scheme is very simple, the resulting structure provides better load regulation especially in  turn-off transients. It is  also proven that the topology does not consume significantly higher ground current nor die area compared to a conventional LDO regulator and does not adversely affect the power supply regulation or start-up time. The measured  results show that output integrated noise is reduced compared to the conventional implementation ESR realization.

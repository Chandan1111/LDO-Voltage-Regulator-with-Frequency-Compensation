## Introduction

POWER management is a very important issue in portable  electronic applications. The need for  multiple  on-chip voltage levels makes voltage regulators a critical part of an electronic system design. Portable electronic devices like cell phones require very efficient power management to increase the battery life whereas high-speed microprocessors need stable voltages that can supply fast varying currents on the order of few amperes.

The choice of a voltage regulator for a given application offers numerous design tradeoff considerations.The emphasis on efficiency has made low dropout (LDO) regulators the most popular class of linear regulators. But this increase in efficiency is achieved at the cost of a compromise in stability of the regulator. LDO regulators have high output impedance; this impedance, along with the load capacitance, creates a low frequency pole and decreases the overall phase margin.

This design gives an overview of stability problems in LDO voltage regulators and presents a modified LDO voltage regulator topology. Although the compensating circuit is very simple, the proposed topology successfully overcomes the problem of stability without significantly increasing the power consumption or die area.


## Problem-with-Typical-LDO-voltage-regulator

## Capacitive-Feedback-for-Frequency-Compensation

The basic idea behind the capacitive feedback which is responsible for frequency compensation is to introduce a left hand plane zero in the feedback loop that would replace the zero generated by ESR of the output capacitor. The proposed method starts with the addition of a pole–zero pair and proceeds toward eliminating the pole from the pole–zero pair.

The capacitor  is split into two frequency-dependent voltage-controlled current sources (VCCS) and grounded capacitors. The capacitor C1 and  the VCCS connected to vout do not significantly  alter  the voltage at that node since  CL is of severa l microfarads, whereas  C1  is on the order of few picofarads. It should also be noted that the  capacitor connected to vx is responsible for the additional pole Wp3; therefore it is eliminated to arrive to the final configuration of Fig. 1. This configuration generates the required zero; the LDO becomes a  two-loop  system. The VCCS is  a differentiator that increases the loop gain at high frequencies. The loop gain transfer function of the regulator with this configuration has one zero and two poles.

	<h5 align="center">Figure 2: LDO voltage regulator topology with proposed frequency compensation</h5>
</p>

## Design-Considerations-for-the-VCCS

The transistor-level design challenge lies in realizing the frequency dependent VCCS with minimum die area and minimum power consumption while retaining the VCCS characteristics up to crossover  frequency of the loop  transfer function. The  simplest  realization of  this  circuit  and  transconductance gain enhanced structure is shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) respectively.The bias current can be selected to meet the objective of minimal standby current; the limit is however determined by the frequency of its parasitic pole.

<p align="center">

	<h5 align="center">Figure 2: Simplest realization of frequency dependent VCCS. (a) Simplest realization and (b) transconductance gain enhanced structure.</h5>
</p>

We need to improve the effective transconductance by increasing the bias current drastically increases the power consumption ( scales proportional to the square root of bias current). Therefore, alternate Gm enhancement techniques should be explored.
The transistor realization is shown in Fig. 3. The circuit consists of three parts. The first stage acts as a level-shifting buffer needed to down-shift the dc level which can be very close to  the  supply  voltage due to LDO characteristics of the regulator. The next stage is with enhancing OTA in feedback. The third stage consists of a 1:5 current mirror and bias sources that together perform  the  function of pumping the ac current through output. We can take advantage of a multiplication factor in the current mirror to increase the effective capacitance from 5 to 25 pF. Cascode current mirror and cascode bias current sources (bias by proper dc voltages and ) are used such that offset current is not significant enough to upset the dc output voltage of the regulator.

</p>

## Error-Amplifier

The error amplifier design demands careful attention to meet the required loop gain, transient response and stability. 
Ideal requirements of the error amplifier are: 1) high dc gain to ensure high loop gain (typically) for all loads; 
					       2) low output impedance to keep the pole at the input of the pass transistor at high frequencies; 
					       3) positive rail output to turn offpass transistor when the load turns off; and 
					       4) internal poles at significantly higher frequencies compared to the cross over loop frequency.
High output impedance of the error amplifier pushes the pole at the input of the pass transistor Wp2 to lower frequencies. Wp2 is pushed to higher frequencies by limiting the output impedance of the error amplifier; hence the use of a two-stage error amplifier is a must.

	<h5 align="center">Figure 4: Transistor level implementation of error amplifier.</h5>
</p>

## Pass-Transistor

The important design consideration for the pass transistor is the dropout voltage. Increasing the size of the pass transistor lowers the dropout voltage for a particular output current, but wider pass transistor introduces higher input capacitance making it difficult to meet stability and slew rate requirements. The design presented uses a pass transistor of W/L ratio of 6000 that gives a maximum output current of 100 mA with a dropout voltage of 0.5 V. Minimum length is not used as it makes the transistor output impedance unacceptably low at high load currents

## Working

This circuit is a Latch based Integrated Clock gating cell (ICG), which produces a clock pulse only whenever a high enable signal is encountered. 2 Transmission gates (2 PMOS, 2 NMOS), 3 Inverters (3 PMOS, 3 NMOS) and 1 AND gate (3 PMOS, 3 NMOS), are used to construct this circuit. To implement negative Dlatch, Transmission gates logic is used. Simply this circuit comprise of negative Dlatch and And gate.
Here when CLK is 0, Enable is (0,1), g1 is ON and output from g1 is (1,0), g2 passes (1,0), output from g4 is (0,1), output of g5 is (1,0), g3 is OFF and will not allow any signal to pass through it, output of g6 is 0 (i.e., ICG_CLK = 0), now when CLK is 1, Enable is (0,1), g1 is OFF and will not allow any signal to pass through it, now g3 is ON now it will pass previously store inverted value, now the output from g4 is non-inverted value now output of g6 is inverted value (i.e., ICG_CLK = Enable)

<p align="center">
	<img width="400" src="Images/Dlatch.png" alt="Negetive level sensitive latch"> 
	<h5 align="center">Figure 1: Latch based ICG</h5>
</p>

In summary when CLK = 0, Dlatch is enabled hence output from Dlatch will change as per enable signal, due to AND gate, the output of ICG = 0 as one of input of AND is 0, When CLK = 1, Dlatch is disabled hence output will be of previous stored value as one of input of AND is 1.
This circuit arrangement is also min pulse width violation free as compared to only AND based clock gating. Latch based clock gating passes one complete cycle of clock whenever the enable signal is High and stops cycle for which enable signal is low.

## Challenge
- The real challange is to adjust W/L ratio of pMos and nMos such that both have approximately equal rise and fall time.

## Troubleshooting
- After a lot of Trail and error found the W/L values of pMOS and nMOS such that both have approximately equal rise and fall time.

## Limitations
- Unnecessary using ICG's on design may increase overall area of the chip, So we have apply to flops having common enable signal which are more than bit width value.

## Introduction

POWER management is a very important issue in portable  electronic applications. The need for  multiple  on-chip voltage levels makes voltage regulators a critical part of an electronic system design. Portable electronic devices like cell phones require very efficient power management to increase the battery life whereas high-speed microprocessors need stable voltages that can supply fast varying currents on the order of few amperes.

The choice of a voltage regulator for a given application offers numerous design tradeoff considerations.The emphasis on efficiency has made low dropout (LDO) regulators the most popular class of linear regulators. But this increase in efficiency is achieved at the cost of a compromise in stability of the regulator. LDO regulators have high output impedance; this impedance, along with the load capacitance, creates a low frequency pole and decreases the overall phase margin.

This design gives an overview of stability problems in LDO voltage regulators and presents a modified LDO voltage regulator topology. Although the compensating circuit is very simple, the proposed topology successfully overcomes the problem of stability without significantly increasing the power consumption or die area.

## Capacitive-Feedback-for-Frequency-Compensation

The basic idea behind the capacitive feedback which is responsible for frequency compensation is to introduce a left hand plane zero in the feedback loop that would replace the zero generated by ESR of the output capacitor. The proposed method starts with the addition of a pole–zero pair and proceeds toward eliminating the pole from the pole–zero pair.

The capacitor is split into two frequency-dependent voltage-controlled current sources (VCCS) and grounded capacitors. The capacitor C1 and the VCCS connected to vout do not significantly alter the voltage at that node since CL is of several microfarads, whereas C1 is on the order of few picofarads. It should also be noted that the capacitor connected to vx is responsible for the additional pole Wp3; therefore it is eliminated to arrive to the final configuration of Fig. 1. This configuration generates the required zero; the LDO becomes a two-loop system. The VCCS is a differentiator that increases the loop gain at high frequencies. The loop gain transfer function of the regulator with this configuration has one zero and two poles.

## Working

This circuit is a Latch based Integrated Clock gating cell (ICG), which produces a clock pulse only whenever a high enable signal is encountered. 2 Transmission gates (2 PMOS, 2 NMOS), 3 Inverters (3 PMOS, 3 NMOS) and 1 AND gate (3 PMOS, 3 NMOS), are used to construct this circuit. To implement negative Dlatch, Transmission gates logic is used. Simply this circuit comprise of negative Dlatch and And gate.
Here when CLK is 0, Enable is (0,1), g1 is ON and output from g1 is (1,0), g2 passes (1,0), output from g4 is (0,1), output of g5 is (1,0), g3 is OFF and will not allow any signal to pass through it, output of g6 is 0 (i.e., ICG_CLK = 0), now when CLK is 1, Enable is (0,1), g1 is OFF and will not allow any signal to pass through it, now g3 is ON now it will pass previously store inverted value, now the output from g4 is non-inverted value now output of g6 is inverted value (i.e., ICG_CLK = Enable)

	<h5 align="center">Figure 1: Latch based ICG</h5>
</p>

In summary when CLK = 0, Dlatch is enabled hence output from Dlatch will change as per enable signal, due to AND gate, the output of ICG = 0 as one of input of AND is 0, When CLK = 1, Dlatch is disabled hence output will be of previous stored value as one of input of AND is 1.
This circuit arrangement is also min pulse width violation free as compared to only AND based clock gating. Latch based clock gating passes one complete cycle of clock whenever the enable signal is High and stops cycle for which enable signal is low.

## Implementation

- Integrated clock gating is implemented by using Inverter, AND and Transmission gate.
- The Aspect ratio of pMOS and nMOS is choosen such a way that it has approximate same transaction and fall time (i.e., The Aspect ratio(W/L) of pMOS is 0.03um/0.24um &  nMOS is 0.03um/0.12um).
- Inverter, AND and Transmission gate are implemeted first then by the help of these sub-design ICG is realised.
- Total transistors used = 18 (9 nMOS & 9 pMOS).
- The MOSFET model chosen is TT model from 28nm PDK.

## Simulation result

- Custom Compiler Waveform

<p align="center">
	<img width="1100" src="Images/Waveform.png" alt="refference ICG Trans"> 
	<h5 align="center">Figure 9: Waveform</h5>
</p>.

## Challenge
- The real challange is to adjust W/L ratio of pMos and nMos such that both have approximately equal rise and fall time.

## Troubleshooting
- After a lot of Trail and error found the W/L values of pMOS and nMOS such that both have approximately equal rise and fall time.

## Limitations
- Unnecessary using ICG's on design may increase overall area of the chip, So we have apply to flops having common enable signal which are more than bit width value.
